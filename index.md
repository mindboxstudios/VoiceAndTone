If you are reading this right now, we like you enough to let you write for Mindbox Studios in some way, shape, or form. Well played. Whether you are writing a blog post for our website or slacking a funny gif to the #random room, we have a way of doing things here. Before we start this journey of exploring the Mindbox brand and how you can best portray it, let’s cover a few things. First, this is a forever growing and changing document. It is alive! Nothing on this document is set in stone. If you disagree with anything on this document or have something to add, let someone know and we can work together to make this the best fit for Mindbox Studios. Second, this wasn’t created to be a set of rules you *must* abide by— simply some tips and tricks to help you write effectively while sticking to the Mindbox brand. 

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get to the fun stuff.

# The Motive

Why are we doing this, you ask? This is here for you to reference whenever you have second thoughts about what you are writing while representing Mindbox Studios. Because we are all representing Mindbox, we want to sound unified and consistent no matter what platform we are occupying. Mindbox has a personality of its own. It has a tone that sets it apart from any other company... and you get to embrace it. Get excited.

Something to keep in mind: You are an independent human being with your own voice and tone. Your **voice** is unique to yourself and we love that. We love that all of our employees are individuals with different strengths and abilities. We don’t want to change your voice. Your **tone** is something that you can change. It is a way to dress up your voice in order to portray a certain feeling or to group yourself with a certain community. With that being said, your tone is about to get a Mindbox makeover. 

For your convenience, here are examples of when you should and shouldn’t wear the Mindbox tone:

- **Do**: Anywhere "we" are speaking (internally and externally)—emails, documents, reports, presentations (live and virtual), social media posts, etc.
- **Don't**: When creating client assets (web design, app building, writing copy for a client, etc.). In these cases, please take care to understand the voice and tone of the partner (per client briefing/documents).


# Our Identity

Something that plays a huge role in the identity of Mindbox is our core values as a company. Check them out:

- Do what’s best for the client even if that isn’t what’s best for Mindbox. 
- Ship quality products that we enjoy using and are proud to claim as our craftsmanship.
- Solve problems in a way that adds true value to the client’s business and Mindbox. 
- Growth isn’t optional. Success equals growing overall revenue, maintaining target margins, and shipping high quality work to our clients.
- Find the right people and train the rest. (This refers to our HR strategy. It has resulted in lower attrition but also requires time and patience.) 


# The Personality

Now that you are a little more familiar with what Mindbox Studios stands for, let’s dig into the personality of Mindbox Studios. The personality lies within the everyday execution of communication when utilizing the Mindbox tone. To help you grasp what the Mindbox personality is, we gave you some simple phrases you can refer back to whenever you need a refresher.

- Design-driven and business-minded
- Energetic and creative
- Passionate and capable
- Fun but focused
- Intelligent but not pretentious
- Conversational but professional

And just incase the phrases aren’t enough, here are examples of how (and how not) to articulate these characteristics.

**Design-driven and business-minded:**
Yes: We sit at the intersection of beautiful design and technical function, while leveraging years of business model development experience to help businesses achieve their technical and financial goals.
No: We can build you the sickest website on this side of the Mississippi.

**Energetic and creative:**
Yes: If you are trying to boost your sales, consider our recommended e-commerce platform to make your product more accessible to consumers and lower your overhead.
No: It’s a bummer no one is buying your product. You should probably invest more into advertising.

**Passionate and capable:**
Yes: We have a vested interest in seeing you succeed, but we don’t want to see you dive in without feeling confident of the first step. We can help you channel your questions into a research study that can refine your MVP and make sure you aren’t wasting your resources or investments.
No: How about we just set you up with a simple wordpress site and see what kind of traffic you receive organically?

**Fun but focused:**
Yes: I just powered through cost reports and need to get the blood pumping. Anyone down for a quick game of foosball?
No: Let’s set up a round robin tournament of foosball to determine the best player in the office. Cost reports can wait for tomorrow.

**Intelligent but not pretentious:**
Yes: With our experience in the industry, we have noticed beautiful custom websites tend to drive the most traffic, in return, giving you the most business.
No: When it comes to custom websites— we are the best of the best. Let us build you a sweet website while you sit back and count your money. 

**Conversational but professional:**
Yes: The 2.0 website is almost finished! The new updates consist of an appointment scheduler, an e-commerce page, and a “full face-lift” of website aesthetics. We plan on pushing this updated site live on Thursday, May 26th.
No: We have a few more bugs to fix on 2.0. We added in a super smooth scheduler plug-in, added e-commerce, and cleaned up the looks. It should be ready on Thursday.


# Writing for Us

**Blog**: If you're struggling to get out your words or have a great idea but no time to put it on paper, get in touch with the media manager. You can talk through your ideas, fill out a quick questionnaire, and then a draft can be put together for you. 

**External Emails**: You are still representing our company, team, and mission. Be personable and have your own voice, but remember to stick close to the Mindbox tone. And most importantly, always re-read your emails before you send them!

**Social Media**: Let’s break this down into two steps. The first step: Our goal for posting social media statuses is to add value to the reader, build our brand, and celebrate our clients in a unique way. With that being said, let’s keep posts going out from Mindbox accounts compatible with this voice and tone guide. Short, sweet, and personable (with a little bit of Mindbox flavor). The second step: Please share from your personal accounts! This is a great way to take pride in Mindbox and spread the word about all the great stuff we are doing. The best part about the second step is this—you should still be following Mindbox voice and tone when you are posting about us on your personal account. Yay! Consistency is key!

**Recruitment**: This one is the crowd favorite. Our goal is to exemplify that Mindbox Studios is an incredible place to work, and the role is exactly what they're looking for, which attracts top talent by clearly explaining the job requirements and giving a quick look into our company culture. NOTE: Don't oversell the cool factor. All startups have an awesome space with awesome benefits and awesome perks. Let them know what makes us more awesome than others. 

# Grammar Lesson

We kept this portion of the guide small because, let’s be honest, no one loves grammar. No one is going to hunt you down if you make a small grammar mistake, and we really aren’t too picky. But, these quick tips are good to review so we can stay as consistent as possible. A majority of this is from the [Yahoo! Style Guide](http://www.amazon.com/The-Yahoo-Style-Guide-Sourcebook/dp/031256984X) for web and grammar standards with our own little Mindbox spin. 

**Abbreviations and acronyms**

We use a lot of abbreviations in the tech world. When in doubt, spell it out (and potentially explain it if you are dealing with a client). If the abbreviation is more common than the long form, then just use the short form. For example: URL. No one uses Uniform Resource Locator.

**Dates**

The easiest way to write out dates and not get them confused is by spelling it out. Spell out the day and abbreviating the month. For example: Thursday, July 9th.

**Exclamation points**

I think we can all agree that people get way too excited about exclamation points. Only use an exclamation point when you’re basically giving someone a high five.

**Extreme writing**

Italic, bold, caps, and underline are beautiful things when used in moderation. Please don’t combine any of these things together. 

**Time zones**

Continental United States time zones:

- Eastern time (EST)
- Central time (CST)
- Mountain time (MST)
- Pacific time (PST)

# Vocab Lesson

We have some unique vocabulary in our repertoire. Some are tech and business related, and some are just the way we speak. This list is forever growing. Feel free to add to it whenever you would like. Without further ado, I present to you the Mindbox Vocab Lesson. Prepare to get schooled. 

**“Atrium”** – A magical land where all projects are divvied up and assigned to employees. This is also where all hours are tracked. Atrium may or may not be the center of the universe.

**“Bruh”** – A way of greeting a male friend or acquaintance. Originated in the bay area. Short for the common term, brother. Bruh-ther. Not broh-ther. It makes more sense to use this word.

**“Designers”** – Designers give life to a website or application’s interface by focusing on usability and client goals.

**“Developers”** – Look around the room. These are the guys blasting techno music through their giant headphones while typing code faster than you can speak english.

**“Foos”** – A combination of soccer and shish kebobs, more commonly known as Foosball. This term is more than a word. It’s a way of life. It is a noun, verb, and adjective. I would recommend you begin training… now.

**“MVP”** – Minimum Viable Product (essentially version 1.0) 

**“Open Mic”** – An occasional meeting that is formally informal. It’s a free for all to throw out ideas, comments, concerns. Its purpose is to get everyone on the same page.

**“Project Leads”** – If Mindbox were a car, these guys are the drivers and navigators. They may not know how to build the car, but they know how it works and where it is supposed to go. Project leads manage projects internally, effectively guiding all work through our development and production pipelines, while also communicating and strategizing with clients. 

**“Stand Up”** – An all-company meeting that takes place everyday from 11:30am-12:00pm. We discuss what projects are being worked on, what tickets are being completed, and when tasks will be completed.

**“Scope of work”** – The area in an agreement where the work to be performed is described. The SOW should contain any milestones, reports, deliverables, and end products that are expected to be provided by Mindbox Studios. The SOW should also contain a time line for all deliverables.

**“Stand Up”** – An all-company meeting that takes place everyday from 11:30am-12:00pm. We discuss what projects are being worked on, what tickets are being completed, and when tasks will be completed.

**“Ticket”** – This is an item created within Atrium that tells the assignee all of the details needed to complete the task, including how long it will take. 

**“UX”** – This is an acronym for user experience. It is the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.

# Vocab Graveyard

We call it a graveyard for a reason. Consider every word and phrase within the graveyard to be dead. These are words and phrases that we want to avoid as a company so we don’t miscommunicate who we are and what we do best. Take a gander at some of the tomb stones:

**“Basic”** – Nothing we do is basic. It might be simple, but never basic.

**“Bug fixes are free”** – We all know that this isn’t true. Therefore, lets not spread it.

**“Click Here!”** – Potentially the worst call-to-action ever created. Just don’t use it. I’m beggin you.

**“Design-first”** – This is known as a bad practice in the tech industry. We aren’t design-first, but we are design-driven and UX-centered.

**“Fixed bid”** – This just isn’t how Mindbox functions. Almost never will a client receive a fixed bid for a project. We will always give them an estimation for expenses based on hours worked on the project.

**“In conclusion”** – Sounds like an academic research paper. You have more personality than that!

**“Small”** – While the team may have less people than other companies, the audience we can reach is much greater than other teams our size could reach; we do not necessarily want to insinuate that there is a size cap for Mindbox's work.

**Swear words** – Come on people, we can’t cuss.

**“We build websites”** – We do so much more than build websites.

**“We update websites”** – Once again, yes—we do. But that isn’t it. We can do far beyond simple updates to websites.

**“We only work with early-stage entrepreneurs”** – Although we enjoy the work we get from this group, we need to continue growing beyond it in order to see sustainable growth.

**“We’re a startup”** – We used to be but we’re not anymore. In many ways our culture still feels like a startup, but nine years of business has taught us things we now confidently share with our clients. We also know how to help our clients while maintaining a profit margin in our business. Most startups are either pre-revenue or pre-profit.

**“Wordpress shop”** – Yes, we can build a really awesome Wordpress site, but we aren’t limited to Wordpress. We have the ability to create amazing custom software.
